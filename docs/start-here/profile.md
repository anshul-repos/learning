Hi, my name is Anshul Tiwari, and I’m from Nagpur.
I’m a Software Developer with around 5.4 years of experience, mostly working with Golang and cloud-native technologies.
I hold B.E. degree in Computer Technology from Nagpur University.

Over the years, I’ve built a strong foundation in backend development and cloud infrastructure, with hands-on experience in Go, Kubernetes, Docker , REST APIs, grpc, CI/CD pipelines, Kafka, graphql, sql and various cloud platforms.

I started my career at Click2Cloud, where I worked on high-performance data APIs and cloud service integrations. I was also involved in migrating critical components from Python to Go.

I then moved to Appointy, where I contributed to Matter Suite, a microservices-based legal management platform. My responsibilities included backend feature development, system design, and database operations.

Currently, I’m working at the IBM R&D unit under Wipro payroll, where I'm serve as a Software Developer in IBMCloud Compute and BareMetal teams. 
I independently led development for bare metal infrastructure for six months, worked on compute services like ELBA VSI with Pensando DPU for enhanced performance and security, and also contributed single-handedly to the Regional Health Status (RHS) project — an internal monitoring and IBM Cloud service availability tool.

Prior to IBM, I worked with Radisys on the Central Broadband Access Controller (CBAC), a VOLTHA-based software controller focused on SDN architecture.

Across these roles, I’ve consistently worked on production-grade, scalable systems and enjoy taking ownership of complex technical challenges. I’m passionate about building reliable, cloud-native solutions that make a tangible impact.
