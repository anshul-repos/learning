## CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)



Core Concepts:

    • CI/CD Pipeline: Understand the stages in a CI/CD pipeline – from code commits, automated testing, building, and deployment.

    • CI/CD Tools: Get familiar with popular CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.

    • Continuous Integration (CI): Automated testing is triggered upon code commits. Make sure to understand how unit tests, integration tests, and linting are automated in the pipeline.

    • Continuous Deployment (CD): Learn how to configure deployment environments (staging, production) and automate the deployment process, including rollback strategies (e.g., blue-green deployments, canary releases).


Key Concepts to Focus on:

    • Pipeline Configuration: How to write a basic pipeline configuration in Jenkinsfile or GitLab CI YAML format.

    • Docker in CI/CD: How Docker containers are used in build, test, and deploy stages (e.g., building Docker images during the pipeline).

    • Automated Testing: How to integrate automated testing in the pipeline (unit, integration, and e2e tests).

    • Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Familiarize yourself with using tools like Terraform or Ansible for managing cloud infrastructure in CI/CD pipelines.


Hands-on Practice:

    • Set up a CI/CD pipeline in GitLab or GitHub Actions for a simple Go project.

    • Ensure the pipeline includes steps for building the Docker image, running tests, and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.
