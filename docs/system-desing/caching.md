    • Caching is a technique used to temporarily store copies of data in high-speed storage layers to reduce the time taken to access data.

    • The primary goal of caching is to improve system performance by reducing latency, offloading the main data store, and providing faster data retrieval.

Caching Strategies:

    • Read-Through Cache: 
        Automatically fetches and caches missing data from source.
    
    • Write-Through Cache: 
        Writes data to cache and source simultaneously.
    
    • Write-Back Cache: 
        Writes to cache first, updates source later.
    
    • Cache-Aside: 
        Application manages data retrieval and cache population.
