Content Delivery Network

    • A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content (like HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users based on their geographic location.

    • The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to end-users with high availability and performance by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.

When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects the request to the nearest server in its network, reducing latency and improving load times.
