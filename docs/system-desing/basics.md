# 📘 System Design Concepts & Interview Guide

## 🏗️ System Design Concepts

1. **Databases**: SQL vs NoSQL  
2. **Scaling**:  
   - Horizontal scaling (adding more machines)  
   - Vertical scaling (upgrading existing machines)  
3. **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance  
4. **Web Authentication & Security**: OAuth, JWT, SSL/TLS, Basic Authentication  
5. **Load Balancers**  
6. **Caching**: Redis, Memcached  
7. **Message Queues**: Kafka, RabbitMQ  
8. **Indexing**: Database Indexing  
9. **Failovers**: Backup & failover strategies  
10. **Replication**: Data duplication  
11. **Consistent Hashing**  
12. **Availability**  
13. **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**  
14. **Rate Limiting**

## 🎯 System Design Interviews (SD)

**Focus:** Designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems.  

### 🔹 Types of Design
- **High-Level Design (HLD)**:  
  Focus on system architecture, component interactions, and overall flow.  
  *Example*: Design systems like Twitter, Uber, etc.  

- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**:  
  Focus on class and object-level design, OOP principles, SOLID, and design patterns.  
  *Example*: Designing class diagrams, object relationships, interfaces.

## ⚙️ Back-End / Distributed System Design

Candidates are asked to design systems that work across multiple servers, regions, or data centers.  

**Key Topics:**
- Backend architecture  
- Database schema design  
- Data partitioning & replication  
- Fault tolerance & high availability  
- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)  
- Consistency models (eventual vs strong)  
- Scalability techniques (sharding, caching)

## 🌐 API System Design

Design APIs that integrate with or power large-scale systems:  

- RESTful or gRPC APIs  
- Endpoint structure & versioning  
- Request validation, throttling, and security (OAuth, JWT)  
- Internal vs external APIs  
- Service boundary identification  

---

## 🧩 Low-Level Design (LLD)

Focus on **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**:  

- Designing classes, objects, and relationships  
- UML class diagrams  
- Defining interfaces and responsibilities  
- Applying design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Singleton, etc.)  
- Ensuring extensibility and testability

## 🏛️ High-Level Design (HLD) Scenarios

Be prepared to discuss **architecture, database design, scaling strategies, and trade-offs** for these systems:  

- 🔗 **URL Shortener** (e.g., Bitly)  
- 🐦 **Social Media Platform** (e.g., Twitter)  
- 📺 **Video Streaming Site** (e.g., YouTube)  
- 💬 **Chat Service** (e.g., Slack, Telegram, Discord)  
- 📁 **File Storage System** (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)  
- 🚗 **Ride Sharing App** (e.g., Uber, Lyft)  
- 📷 **Photo Sharing App** (e.g., Flickr, Pinterest)  
- 🛒 **E-commerce Platform** (e.g., Amazon, eBay)  
- 🧑‍💼 **Job Portal** (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed)  
- 🌐 **Web Crawler** (e.g., Googlebot)
