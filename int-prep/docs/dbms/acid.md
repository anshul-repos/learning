The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure the reliability, consistency, and robustness of transactions in a database management system (DBMS).



1. **Atomicity**: 

    â€¢ `Definition`: A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit that either completes entirely or does not occur at all.

    â€¢ `Key Point`: There is no partial completion of a transaction.

    â€¢ `Example`:
If a transaction involves transferring money from one account to another:

        â—‹ Debit â‚¹1000 from Account A.
        â—‹ Credit â‚¹1000 to Account B. 
        
        If either operation fails (e.g., system crash), neither operation is performed, and the database remains unchanged.
        
2. **Consistency**:

    â€¢ `Definition`: A transaction must transition the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all defined rules and constraints.

    â€¢ `Key Point`: The database must remain consistent before and after the transaction.

    â€¢ `Example`:
    If a banking rule requires that the total balance of all accounts must remain the same before and after a transaction, this rule must hold regardless of the transaction's success or failure.
    
3. **Isolation**:

    â€¢ `Definition`: Transactions must operate independently of one another. If multiple transactions are occurring simultaneously, the execution of one transaction should not affect the outcome of others.

    â€¢ `Key Point`: Intermediate states of a transaction must remain hidden from other transactions.

    â€¢ `Example`:
If two users are booking the last seat on a flight at the same time:
        
        Only one transaction should succeed, while the other must be aware of the updated seat availability.
        
4. **Durability**:

    â€¢ `Definition`: Once a transaction is successfully completed, its changes must be permanent and persist in the database, even in the event of a system crash or power failure.

    â€¢ `Key Point`: Data changes are saved to non-volatile storage.

    â€¢ `Example`:
After successfully transferring â‚¹1000, the updated account balances must remain recorded even if the system crashes immediately afterward.

# ACID Properties in Databases

ACID properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions. They stand for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**.

## ðŸ“Š ACID Properties

| **Property**   | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity**  | All operations in a transaction either complete or have no effect.              | Money transfer: If debit fails, credit is also rolled back.                |
| **Consistency**| The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.         | Ensuring total balance across accounts remains constant after transactions.|
| **Isolation**  | Transactions occur independently without interference.                          | Two users booking the last seat wonâ€™t see incomplete states of each otherâ€™s transactions. |
| **Durability** | Committed transactions are permanently saved, even after a crash.               | Money transferred to an account remains recorded after a system reboot.    |

## âœ… Summary

- **Atomicity** ensures transactions are all-or-nothing.  
- **Consistency** guarantees valid database states before and after a transaction.  
- **Isolation** prevents concurrent transactions from interfering.  
- **Durability** ensures committed data persists, even after failures.

# ACID Properties in Databases

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions.  
It stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Atomicity
- **Definition:** Ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.  
- **Example:** Money transfer: If debit fails, the credit operation is also rolled back.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Consistency
- **Definition:** Guarantees that a database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.  
- **Example:** Ensuring total balance across accounts remains constant after transactions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Isolation
- **Definition:** Ensures that transactions occur independently without interference, even if executed concurrently.  
- **Example:** Two users booking the last seat wonâ€™t see incomplete states of each otherâ€™s transactions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Durability
- **Definition:** Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved in the database, even in the event of a crash.  
- **Example:** Money transferred to an account remains recorded after a system reboot.
