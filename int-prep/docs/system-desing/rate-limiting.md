Rate limiting helps protects services from being overwhelmed by too many requests from a single user or client.

Rate Limiting Algorithms: 

    Token Bucket: 
        Allows bursts traffic within overall rate limit.
    
    Leaky Bucket: 
        Smooths traffic flow at constant rate.
    
    Fixed Window Counter: 
        Limits requests in fixed time intervals.
    
    Sliding Window Log: 
        Tracks requests within rolling time window.
    
    Sliding Window Counter: 
        Smooths rate between adjacent fixed windows.
