#Problems:

    1. Factorial of number:
        Write a function that takes a non-negative integer n and returns its factorial, n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1.
    2. Fibonacci sequence:
        Write a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1.
    3. Sum of array elements:
        Write a recursive function that returns the sum of elements in an array.
    4. Reverse a string
        Write a recursive function to reverse a string.
    5. Find minimum num in array:
        Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array.
    6. Check string if palindrome:
        Write a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome.
    7. Power of number:
        Write a recursive function to calculate x raised to the power n (i.e., x^n).
    8. Print All Subsets of a Set (Power Set)
        Write a recursive function to print all the subsets of a given set (represented as a slice).
    9. Tower of Hanoi
        Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for n disks. The task is to move n disks from the source peg to the target peg using an auxiliary peg.
    10. Permutation of string
        Write a recursive function to generate all permutations of a string
        
        
        
How to Use These Problems to Master Recursion:

    1. Understand the Base Case: Every recursive function needs a base case. This is the condition under which the recursion stops.
    2. Work Through Small Examples: For each problem, walk through the recursion step by step on a small example to understand how the problem is being solved.
    3. Memoize to Optimize: Once you’re comfortable with recursion, try adding memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems (useful in problems like Fibonacci and knapsack).
    4. Practice with Debugging: Use print statements or a debugger to trace the recursive calls. This will help you see the "call




    General Approach:
        • Base condition
        • Recursive call with smaller input
