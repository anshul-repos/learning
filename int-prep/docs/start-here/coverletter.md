Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I am writing to express my interest in the Golang Developer position at [Company Name]. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in designing and building robust backend systems using Golang, I bring a deep understanding of high-performance APIs, scalable microservices, and production-grade deployments.

In my recent role at IBM ISL via Wipro, I enhanced the reliability and availability of Bare-metal nodes and improved system monitoring in IBM Cloud using Ginkgo/Gomega, Redis, and gRPC. At Radisys, I developed microservices to virtualize OLT functions, improving deployment efficiency by 40% and system reliability by 25%. I’ve consistently contributed to code quality, system performance, and testing coverage.

I’m enthusiastic about joining [Company Name] to solve meaningful challenges using clean, efficient, and scalable Go code. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your backend architecture and collaborate with talented engineers.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
